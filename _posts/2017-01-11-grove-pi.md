# Grove Pi

This blog is to catalogue my experience setting up a new Raspberry Pi 3 with a set of Grove tools.

### Introduction

For those not familiar Grove, it is a range of sensors produced with standardised sockets. This allows them to be used on special shields without the need for a breadboard. This makes prototyping super fast.

They were originally designed for Arduino pin headers, but they are also compatible with Netduino and Raspberry Pi, through special shields and drivers.

###

Raspberry Pi 3 was chosen for its onboard wifi and beefiness, which means I can get set up faster. Also it has the standard Raspberry Pi headers, meaning it is compatible with the Grove Pi shield.

The cheaper, more cost-efficient Raspberry Pi Nano can be used once a project has been successfully validated.

###

Installation:

Order the NOOBS SD-Card. Trust me :). It comes with the latest built-in Raspbian image, along with the option install a number of others over network.

Grove: To install this, I followed the manual steps here https://www.dexterindustries.com/GrovePi/get-started-with-the-grovepi/setting-software/.
